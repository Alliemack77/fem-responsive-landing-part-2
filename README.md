# Build a Responsive Website with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript | Part 2

This is my solution to the Frontend Mentor Project, [News Homepage](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl). Itâ€™s never been easier to create responsive layouts that look beautiful on every screen.

This is Part 2 of the mini-series where I build out this landing page from scratch. Checkout the [first video in this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkxXterRidg&t=26s) on my YouTube channel, [CSS {de}Coder](https://www.youtube.com/@CSSdeCoder).
